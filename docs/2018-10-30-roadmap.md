### Evaluating Stability of Diffusion Roadmap

- [x] Choose datasets to process
> Subset of CoRR; 2 sessions from 30 subjects from each of BNU3, HNU1, SWU4

- [ ] Perform eddy current correction on all data
> Using the same routine, likely FSL's `eddy` (supporting data permitting) or `eddy_correct`, on all data.

- [ ] Align all data to MNI152 & manually quality control
> In order to not distort the data, the transform mapping from subject DWI space to MNI152 space will be inverted and applied to the brain mask, atlas, and parcellation labels so that connectomes can be generated in native space and still ultimately compared.

- [ ] Write and containerize pipelines to accept the preprocessed data
> Using MRTrix, FSL, and Dipy.

- [ ] Compute some feature on resulting connectomes for each
> Starting with a network statistic, like Degree sequence, ranked edge sequence, etc... Eventually considering things for fiber comparison.

- [ ] Perturb data with noise and re-run each tool
> So we can plot the difference with respect to noise.
