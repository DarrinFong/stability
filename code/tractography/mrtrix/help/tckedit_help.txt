MRtrix 0.3.12                        tckedit                         Aug 12 2019

     tckedit: part of the MRtrix package

SYNOPSIS

     tckedit [ options ] tracks_in [ tracks_in ... ] tracks_out

        tracks_in    the input track file(s)

        tracks_out   the output track file


DESCRIPTION

     perform various editing operations on track files.

Region Of Interest processing options

  -include spec
     specify an inclusion region of interest, as either a binary mask image, or
     as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values (x,y,z,radius). Streamlines
     must traverse ALL inclusion regions to be accepted.

  -exclude spec
     specify an exclusion region of interest, as either a binary mask image, or
     as a sphere using 4 comma-separared values (x,y,z,radius). Streamlines
     that enter ANY exclude region will be discarded.

  -mask spec
     specify a masking region of interest, as either a binary mask image, or as
     a sphere using 4 comma-separared values (x,y,z,radius). If defined,
     streamlines exiting the mask will be truncated.

Streamline length threshold options

  -maxlength value
     set the maximum length of any streamline in mm

  -minlength value
     set the minimum length of any streamline in mm

Streamline resampling options

  -upsample ratio
     increase the density of points along the length of the streamline by some
     factor (may improve mapping streamlines to ROIs, and/or visualisation)

  -downsample ratio
     increase the density of points along the length of the streamline by some
     factor (decreases required storage space)

Streamline count truncation options

  -number count
     set the desired number of selected streamlines to be propagated to the
     output file

  -skip count
     omit this number of selected streamlines before commencing writing to the
     output file

Thresholds pertaining to per-streamline weighting

  -maxweight value
     set the maximum weight of any streamline

  -minweight value
     set the minimum weight of any streamline

  -inverse
     output the inverse selection of streamlines based on the criteria
     provided, i.e. only those streamlines that fail at least one criterion
     will be written to file.

  -tck_weights_in path
     specify a text scalar file containing the streamline weights

  -tck_weights_out path
     specify the path for an output text scalar file containing streamline
     weights

Standard options

  -info
     display information messages.

  -quiet
     do not display information messages or progress status.

  -debug
     display debugging messages.

  -force
     force overwrite of output files.

  -nthreads number
     use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications

  -failonwarn
     terminate program if a warning is produced

  -help
     display this information page and exit.

  -version
     display version information and exit.
