MRtrix 3.0_RC3  dwi2response     bin version: 3.0_RC3


     dwi2response: Script using the MRtrix3 Python library

SYNOPSIS

     Estimate response function(s) for spherical deconvolution

USAGE

     dwi2response [ options ] algorithm ...

        algorithm    Select the algorithm to be used to complete the script operation;
                     additional details and options become available once an
                     algorithm is nominated. Options are: dhollander, fa,
                     manual, msmt_5tt, tax, tournier

DESCRIPTION

     dwi2response acts as a 'master' script for performing various types of
     response function estimation; a range of different algorithms are available
     for completing this task. When using this script, the name of the algorithm
     to be used must appear as the first argument on the command-line after
     'dwi2response'. The subsequent compulsory arguments and options available
     depend on the particular algorithm being invoked.

     Each algorithm available also has its own help page, including necessary
     references; e.g. to see the help page of the 'fa' algorithm, type
     'dwi2response fa'.

Options common to all dwi2response algorithms

  -shells SHELLS
     The b-value shell(s) to use in response function estimation (single value
     for single-shell response, comma-separated list for multi-shell response)

  -lmax LMAX
     The maximum harmonic degree(s) of response function estimation (single
     value for single-shell response, comma-separated list for multi-shell
     response)

  -mask MASK
     Provide an initial mask for response voxel selection

  -voxels VOXELS
     Output an image showing the final voxel selection(s)

  -grad GRAD
     Pass the diffusion gradient table in MRtrix format

  -fslgrad bvecs bvals
     Pass the diffusion gradient table in FSL bvecs/bvals format

Standard options

  -continue <TempDir> <LastFile>
     Continue the script from a previous execution; must provide the temporary
     directory path, and the name of the last successfully-generated file

  -force
     Force overwrite of output files if pre-existing

  -help
     Display help information for the script

  -nocleanup
     Do not delete temporary files during script, or temporary directory at
     script completion

  -nthreads number
     Use this number of threads in MRtrix multi-threaded applications (0
     disables multi-threading)

  -tempdir /path/to/tmp/
     Manually specify the path in which to generate the temporary directory

  -quiet
     Suppress all console output during script execution

  -info
     Display additional information and progress for every command invoked

  -debug
     Display additional debugging information over and above the output of -info
